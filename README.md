# Food101
Welcome to the Food101 Collab Notebook! This notebook is a collaborative project that aims to classify images of food into 101 different categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Food101 dataset, which consists of 101,000 images of food categorized into 101 classes. The images are of varying sizes and aspect ratios, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training set consists of 75,750 images, while the testing set consists of 25,250 images.

## Model
We will be using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images. The CNN will consist of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. We will be using the PyTorch deep learning framework to build and train our model.

## Instructions
To get started, you will need to have the Food101 dataset downloaded and saved to your local machine or cloud storage. The dataset can be downloaded from the official Food101 website (https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/).

Once you have the dataset downloaded, you can run the code in the notebook to preprocess the data and train the model. You can also modify the hyperparameters and architecture of the model to experiment and improve the performance.
